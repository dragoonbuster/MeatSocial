# MeatSocial

A social platform that guarantees every user is human. Starting as a Twitter-like network with bulletproof verification, evolving into foundational internet infrastructure for human-only communication.

## Vision

MeatSocial solves the fundamental problem of bot-infested social media by requiring physical, in-person verification. No AI can visit our verification nodes. No algorithm can fake human presence. Only real people, having real conversations.

## How It Works

1. **Physical Verification**: Visit a verification node in your city with government ID
2. **Cryptographic Proof**: Receive tamper-proof digital certificate of humanity
3. **Social Platform**: Post, follow, and message other verified humans
4. **Trust Network**: Build reputation through authentic human interactions

## Core Features

- Human-only social feeds and messaging
- Physical verification nodes in major cities
- Zero-knowledge privacy protection
- Anti-addictive design principles
- Geographic trust clustering
- Time-locked posting for thoughtful communication

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1**: Social platform MVP (6 months)
- **Phase 2**: Browser extension for web-wide verification (12 months)
- **Phase 3**: Custom protocol layer (24 months)
- **Phase 4**: Alternative internet infrastructure (24+ months)
