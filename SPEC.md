# MeatSocial Technical Specification v1.0

## Vision Statement

MeatSocial becomes the foundational layer for human-verified internet communication. Starting as a Twitter-like social platform, it evolves into protocol-level infrastructure that guarantees human participation across the entire web.

**Evolution Path**: Social App → Browser Extension → Custom Protocol → Internet Layer

## Core Principles

1. **Certainty Over Convenience**: Perfect human verification trumps user experience friction
2. **Privacy by Design**: Verification without surveillance or data collection
3. **Physical Anchoring**: Digital trust rooted in physical world interactions
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Each layer works independently if others fail
5. **Human Rhythm**: Platform deliberately operates at human speeds

## Security Architecture

### Attack Vectors and Mitigations

**1. Fake Verification Nodes**
- *Attack*: Adversary sets up fake node to generate false verifications
- *Mitigation*: 
  - Centralized node operator vetting and certification
  - Cryptographic node signing keys
  - Regular audit visits to physical locations
  - Community reporting system

**2. Account Selling/Transfer**
- *Attack*: Verified human sells account to bot operator
- *Mitigation*:
  - Continuous behavioral monitoring (typing patterns, interaction rhythms)
  - Device fingerprinting with secure element binding
  - Social graph analysis for sudden relationship changes
  - Regular re-verification requirements

**3. AI Verification Bypass**
- *Attack*: Advanced AI passes human verification tests
- *Mitigation*:
  - Physical presence requirement (AI can't visit nodes)
  - Evolving verification challenges based on current AI limitations
  - Multi-modal verification (visual + behavioral + temporal)
  - Human verifier oversight at nodes

**4. Sybil Attacks**
- *Attack*: One human creates many verified accounts
- *Mitigation*:
  - One verification per ID document
  - Biometric binding (photo comparison)
  - Economic cost per verification ($20-50)
  - Cross-reference with government databases

**5. Privacy Breaches**
- *Attack*: Verification data used to identify users
- *Mitigation*:
  - Zero-knowledge proofs for verification status
  - Immediate deletion of biometric data after proof generation
  - Tor/VPN compatibility post-verification
  - Minimal data collection policies

### Data Security Model

**Zero-Trust Architecture**:
- All communications end-to-end encrypted
- Verification proofs cryptographically signed
- No plaintext PII stored on servers
- Client-side data encryption with user-controlled keys

**Verification Data Lifecycle**:
1. Capture at node (photo + ID)
2. Generate cryptographic proof
3. Delete source data within 60 seconds
4. Store only anonymous proof hash

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Human-Centered Design

**Verification Experience**:
- Node locations shown on friendly map interface
- Appointment booking system with calendar integration
- Clear explanation of data usage and deletion
- Gamified verification progress (without being patronizing)

**Time-Lock UX**:
- Progress bars showing "reflection time" before posts go live
- Gentle animations that make delays feel intentional
- Batch notifications to reduce ADHD-triggering patterns
- "Slow mode" vs "instant mode" toggle for user choice

**Trust Visualization**:
- Humanity scores shown as subtle color gradients (not numbers)
- Verification badges that are beautiful, not corporate
- Network visualization showing connections to other humans
- Geographic trust radius maps

### Accessibility First

**Physical Verification**:
- Alternative verification for mobility-limited users
- Multi-language support at nodes
- Sign language interpretation available
- Audio-described verification process

**Digital Interface**:
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode
- Simplified UI option for cognitive accessibility

- **Resident**: Continuous verification (6 months)
- **Citizen**: High trust + vouching privileges (2 years)
- **Elder**: Community moderation powers (5 years)

### Geographic Trust Clusters
Users build stronger trust with geographically nearby humans:
- Local news and events prioritized
- Neighborhood-level verification bonuses
- Real-world meetup coordination
- Emergency communication networks

### Slow Media Features
Embrace anti-addictive design:
- Daily post limits that decrease with usage
- Mandatory break reminders
- Content that expires after 24 hours
- "Deep read" mode that locks scrolling

### Cross-Platform Verification Bridge
API for other platforms to verify humanity:
- Dating apps using MeatSocial verification
- E-commerce sites with human-only reviews
- Forums with verified human participation
- Gaming platforms with anti-cheat integration

## Critical Decisions Made

**Removed Conflicting Ideas**:
- Eliminated all cryptocurrency/token concepts
- Chose browser extension over mobile app for Phase 2 (broader reach)
- Simplified verification to physical-only (no biometric complications)
- Focused on TCP/IP layer rather than alternative protocols initially

**Key UX Decisions**:
- Time-locking is optional in early phases (user choice)
- Verification is expensive enough to matter ($20-50) but not exclusionary
- Geographic clustering for trust (local-first social)
- Anti-addictive design principles throughout

**Security-First Approach**:
- Physical verification as non-negotiable foundation
- Zero-knowledge architecture from day one
- Assume nation-state level adversaries in design
- Plan for AI advancement outpacing current detection
